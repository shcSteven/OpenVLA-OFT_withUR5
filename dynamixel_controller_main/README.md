# dynamixel controller

## Purpose of this repository
- ROBOTIS provides an SDK package to communicate and control their Dynamixel servo motors
- The SDK package is low level, and thus abstractions must be made
- Useful abstractions in python will be pushed to this repo to be used by the lab

## More information
- Everything is build upon [this SDK](https://github.com/ROBOTIS-GIT/DynamixelSDK)
- You can install the package using pip (see [this page](https://pypi.org/project/dynamixel-sdk/))
